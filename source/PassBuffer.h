/**
	An off-screen buffer: one slot of the frame ring, or one stage of the
	inverse-telecine measurement.

	Three things on top of the SDK's FFGLFBO, all inherited from the fleet.

	**It reallocates only when it has to.** `Ensure()` is called every frame
	for every slot and is a no-op in the overwhelming majority of them.

	**It actually frees its colour texture.** `ffglex::FFGLFBO::Release()`
	deletes the framebuffer and the depth renderbuffer, then tests
	`depthBufferID` a second time where it plainly meant `colorTextureID` --
	so the colour texture is leaked on every release (SDK b1afaf9,
	`FFGLFBO.cpp`). `Destroy()` deletes it first. The ring here rebuilds on
	every resize and every change of Field Source, and an operator dragging a
	layer's size is asking for eight full pictures to be released a few
	times a second.

	**It owns its filtering.** Every buffer in this plugin is read with
	`texelFetch` -- a field is a set of integer rows, and a bilinear sample
	across two rows is a sample across two fields -- so `Nearest` is the
	only sampling anything here wants. The other two are kept because the
	trap of choosing wrongly is silent: `GL_LINEAR` on a data buffer does
	not fail, it returns plausible averages of unrelated numbers.
