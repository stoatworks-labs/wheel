/**
	How long the last frame was, which FFGL does not say.

	Two problems, both of which look trivial and are not.

	**What unit is the host's clock in?** The FFGL header never says. Resolume
	hands over milliseconds -- measured live in Arena 7.27.1 at 20.0 per frame at
	its 50 fps, and the SDK's own Particles sample divides by 1000 -- while the
	offline harness, and any host taking the header's silence at face value,
	sends seconds. Guess wrong here and every envelope in Audio.cpp runs 1000x
	fast or 1000x slow: an attack of 10 ms becomes 10 s, the audio side appears
	simply not to work, and no in-repo test can catch it because the harness is
	the one sending seconds. So the unit is *measured* against a wall clock over
	the first few frames and then stuck to.

	**How long was this frame?** The difference between two readings, clamped.
	Unclamped, the first frame after a window drag or a transport scrub reports
	half a second, every envelope jumps to its target at once, and the picture
	takes a visible lurch for one frame. Clamping is one line and it is not
	optional.

	This is vectrix's Clock with the sample-rate arithmetic removed -- that
	plugin needs to know how many audio samples a frame is worth and this one
	only needs the seconds. Kept as a copy rather than shared: the fleet has no
	common library, and a header shared between two repos by hand is a header
	that diverges silently.
